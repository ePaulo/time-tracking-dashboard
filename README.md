![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build a dashboard based on the designs and JSON data provided.

### Style Guide

A Style Guide, `style-guide.md`, was provided and used for color palette and fonts.

### Expected behaviour

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

The text for the previous period's time changes based on the active timeframe.

- For Daily, it displays "Yesterday", e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs".
- For Weekly, it displays "Last Week", e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs".
- For monthly, it displays "Last Month", e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".
